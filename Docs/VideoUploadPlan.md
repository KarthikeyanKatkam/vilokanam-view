# Video Upload Plan for Vilokanam-view Platform

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing video uploading capabilities in the Vilokanam-view platform. Currently, the platform has a basic structure with blockchain integration for the pay-per-second model, but lacks actual video uploading, processing, and playback functionality.

## Current State Analysis

### Backend
- Substrate-based blockchain node with custom pallets
- Tick-stream pallet for tracking viewer engagement
- Payment-handler pallet (planned) for micro-payments
- Stream-registry pallet (planned) for stream metadata
- Pricing-engine pallet (planned) for dynamic pricing

### Frontend
- Viewer application with basic stream information display
- Creator dashboard with stream creation functionality
- UI component library
- Blockchain SDK for pallet interactions

### Missing Components
1. Video storage and retrieval system
2. Video processing and transcoding pipeline
3. Video playback interface
4. User authentication and profile management
5. Video search and discovery features
6. Social features (following, comments, reactions)
7. Analytics and reporting for creators
8. Content moderation tools

## Video Upload Implementation Plan

### 1. Storage Architecture

#### Decentralized Storage Options
- IPFS for permanent storage of original videos
- Filecoin for incentivized storage
- Arweave for archival storage

#### Hybrid Approach
- Temporary storage in cloud storage (S3-compatible) for processing
- Permanent storage on IPFS/Filecoin for distribution
- CDN for optimized delivery

### 2. Upload Process Flow

#### Frontend Upload Component
1. Drag-and-drop interface for video files
2. Progress indicator with upload speed
3. File validation (format, size limits)
4. Metadata collection (title, description, tags)
5. Thumbnail upload or generation

#### Backend Processing
1. Receive uploaded video file
2. Validate file integrity and format
3. Store temporarily in processing queue
4. Trigger transcoding pipeline
5. Generate multiple resolutions
6. Create thumbnails and preview images
7. Store processed videos in permanent storage
8. Update metadata in blockchain and database

### 3. Video Processing Pipeline

#### Transcoding
- FFmpeg-based processing for multiple resolutions
- H.264/H.265 encoding for compatibility
- Adaptive bitrate streaming support
- Generation of multiple quality versions

#### Metadata Extraction
- Duration, resolution, bitrate
- Codec information
- Creation date and device info
- Audio track information

#### Thumbnail Generation
- Multiple thumbnails at different timestamps
- Sprite sheets for scrubbing previews
- Custom thumbnail upload option

### 4. Database Schema Design

#### Videos Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE videos (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    creator_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    ipfs_hash VARCHAR(255),
    status VARCHAR(50), -- uploading, processing, ready, failed
    duration INTEGER,
    resolution_width INTEGER,
    resolution_height INTEGER,
    file_size BIGINT,
    views_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Video Versions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE video_versions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    video_id UUID REFERENCES videos(id),
    resolution VARCHAR(20), -- 240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p
    ipfs_hash VARCHAR(255),
    file_size BIGINT,
    bitrate INTEGER
);
```

#### Video Metadata Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE video_metadata (
    video_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES videos(id),
    format VARCHAR(50),
    codec VARCHAR(50),
    audio_codec VARCHAR(50),
    frame_rate DECIMAL,
    aspect_ratio VARCHAR(20),
    tags TEXT[] -- Array of tags
);
```
