# Vilokanam-view Development Summary

## Project Overview

Vilokanam-view is a revolutionary pay-per-second live streaming platform built on the Polkadot ecosystem. The platform enables content creators to earn money based on actual viewer engagement time, with real-time payments processed through the Polkadot network using blockchain technology.

## Implementation Progress

We have successfully implemented a functional core of the streaming platform with the following key components:
