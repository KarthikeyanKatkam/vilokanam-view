## 1. Project Overview

Vilokanam-view introduces a revolutionary monetization model for live streaming platforms, leveraging blockchain technology to create a direct, transparent, and fair revenue-sharing ecosystem. The platform features:

### Core Features

- **Pay-Per-Second Billing**: Viewers pay only for the exact time they spend watching content
- **Real-Time Payments**: Instant micropayments processed through the Polkadot network
- **Transparent Pricing**: Clear rate display with no hidden fees
- **Decentralized Architecture**: Built on Substrate framework for blockchain security
- **Creator Empowerment**: Direct revenue from viewer engagement
- **Viewer Benefits**: Transparent pricing with no commitments

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Rust, Substrate, Polkadot SDK
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Polkadot parachain with custom runtime
- **Storage**: IPFS for decentralized content storage
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki

## 2. Technical Architecture

The platform follows a layered architecture with distinct components:

### Backend (Polkadot Parachain)
- Custom runtime with FRAME pallets for streaming functionality
- Consensus mechanism (Aura/GRANDPA)
- Off-chain workers for automated tick processing
- RPC extensions for frontend integration

### Frontend (Next.js + React)
- Creator dashboard application
- Viewer interface application
- UI component library
- SDK for blockchain interactions

### Infrastructure
- Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Docker for containerization
- Cloudflare for CDN and DDoS protection
- PostgreSQL for structured data
- Redis for caching
- IPFS for decentralized storage

## 3. Development Roadmap
