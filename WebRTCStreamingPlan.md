# WebRTC Live Streaming Plan for Vilokanam-view Platform

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing WebRTC-based live streaming capabilities in the Vilokanam-view platform. WebRTC provides low-latency, peer-to-peer streaming that's ideal for interactive live streaming experiences.

## Current State Analysis

The platform currently has:
- Basic creator dashboard for stream creation
- Viewer interface with stream information
- Blockchain integration for pay-per-second billing
- Missing actual live streaming infrastructure

## WebRTC Implementation Plan

### 1. Architecture Overview

#### Signaling Server
- WebSocket-based signaling for connection establishment
- Session management for streamers and viewers
- Integration with existing backend services
- Connection to blockchain for authentication and payment

#### WebRTC Components
- SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) for scalable broadcasting
- TURN/STUN servers for NAT traversal
- Media servers for handling WebRTC connections
- Recording functionality for stream archives

#### Client-side Implementation
- WebRTC library integration (Mediasoup, Janus, or custom)
- Camera/microphone access and stream capture
- Adaptive bitrate streaming
- Error handling and reconnection logic

### 2. Signaling Protocol Design

#### Stream Creation
1. Creator requests to start a stream
2. Backend creates stream record with unique ID
3. Signaling server prepares session
4. Stream key is generated and provided to creator

#### Viewer Connection
1. Viewer requests to join a stream
2. Backend validates viewer authorization
3. Signaling server facilitates WebRTC handshake
4. Media streams are established between peers

#### Real-time Communication
1. ICE candidate exchange
2. SDP offer/answer negotiation
3. Stream quality adaptation
4. Connection health monitoring

### 3. SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) Implementation

#### Media Routing
- Receive video streams from broadcasters
- Forward streams to appropriate viewers
- Handle multiple quality levels
- Manage bandwidth allocation

#### Scalability Features
- Horizontal scaling of SFU instances
- Load balancing between SFU nodes
- Automatic stream distribution
- Resource monitoring and optimization

### 4. TURN/STUN Server Setup

#### NAT Traversal
- Public STUN servers for simple NAT scenarios
- TURN servers for symmetric NAT environments
- Automatic fallback mechanisms
- Bandwidth and connection monitoring

### 5. Client-side Implementation

#### Creator Dashboard Integration
- Camera and microphone access controls
- Stream preview before broadcasting
- Stream controls (start/stop, mute/unmute)
- Connection status indicators
- Stream quality settings

#### Viewer Interface Integration
- Stream selection and joining
- Real-time payment integration
- Quality selection controls
- Interactive features (chat, reactions)

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Signaling Server

#### Technology Stack
- Node.js with WebSocket library (Socket.IO or ws)
- Redis for session storage and pub/sub
- Integration with existing backend APIs
- Authentication with Polkadot wallet integration

#### API Endpoints
```javascript
// Create stream session
POST /api/stream/create
{
  "title": "My Live Stream",
  "description": "Streaming session",
  "category": "gaming"
}

// Get stream information
GET /api/stream/{streamId}

// Join stream as viewer
POST /api/stream/{streamId}/join
{
  "viewerId": "account_address"
}

// Get signaling server connection info
GET /api/stream/{streamId}/signaling
```

### 2. WebRTC SFU Implementation

#### Technology Choices
- Mediasoup as SFU (recommended for scalability)
- Docker containers for easy deployment
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Prometheus metrics for monitoring

#### Core Components
- Worker processes for media handling
- Routers for stream distribution
- Transports for network communication
- Producers for incoming media
- Consumers for outgoing media

### 3. Client Libraries

#### Creator Side
```javascript
// Initialize broadcaster
const broadcaster = new Broadcaster({
  signalingServer: 'wss://signaling.vilokanam-view.com',
  streamId: 'unique-stream-id'
});

// Start broadcasting
await broadcaster.startStream({
  video: true,
  audio: true,
  resolution: '720p',
  bitrate: 2000
});

// Stop broadcasting
broadcaster.stopStream();
```

#### Viewer Side
```javascript
// Initialize viewer
const viewer = new Viewer({
  signalingServer: 'wss://signaling.vilokanam-view.com',
  streamId: 'unique-stream-id'
});

// Join stream
await viewer.joinStream();

// Handle payment integration
viewer.on('tick', (data) => {
  // Trigger blockchain payment for tick
  payPerSecond(data.seconds);
});
```

## Integration with Blockchain

### Stream Authentication
- Verify creator identity through wallet signature
- Validate viewer payment capability
- Record stream creation on blockchain
- Update stream status in real-time

### Payment Integration
- Real-time tick counting during stream
- Automatic payment triggering every second
- Balance checking before stream access
- Transaction recording on blockchain

### Metadata Management
- Store stream metadata on IPFS
- Link blockchain records with IPFS hashes
- Update stream information in real-time
- Archive stream data after completion

## Database Schema for Live Streaming
