# Technical Architecture: Vilokanam-view Live Streaming Platform

## System Overview

Vilokanam-view employs a layered architecture that combines blockchain technology with modern web development practices. The system consists of three primary layers:

1. **Blockchain Layer**: Built on Substrate framework as a Polkadot parachain
2. **Backend Services Layer**: Off-chain workers and supporting services
3. **Frontend Layer**: Next.js applications for creators and viewers

## Blockchain Architecture

### Runtime Design

The Vilokanam parachain runtime is built using the FRAME framework and includes four custom pallets:

#### 1. Tick-Stream Pallet
```rust
// Core storage items
#[pallet::storage]
#[pallet::getter(fn tick_count)]
pub type TickCount<T: Config> = StorageMap<_, Blake2_128Concat, u128, u32, ValueQuery>;

#[pallet::storage]
#[pallet::getter(fn stream_viewers)]
pub type StreamViewers<T: Config> = StorageMap<_, Blake2_128Concat, u128, Vec<T::AccountId>, ValueQuery>;

// Events
#[pallet::event]
#[pallet::generate_deposit(pub(super) fn deposit_event)]
pub enum Event<T: Config> {
    TickRecorded {
        stream_id: u128,
        viewer: T::AccountId,
        ticks: u32,
    },
    ViewerJoined {
        stream_id: u128,
        viewer: T::AccountId,
    },
}

// Extrinsics
#[pallet::call]
impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
    #[pallet::call_index(0)]
    #[pallet::weight((10_000, DispatchClass::Normal))]
    pub fn record_tick(
        origin: OriginFor<T>,
        stream_id: u128,
        viewer: T::AccountId,
        ticks: u32,
    ) -> DispatchResult {
        ensure_signed(origin)?;
        // Implementation details
    }
    
    #[pallet::call_index(1)]
    #[pallet::weight((10_000, DispatchClass::Normal))]
    pub fn join_stream(
        origin: OriginFor<T>,
        stream_id: u128,
    ) -> DispatchResult {
        let who = ensure_signed(origin)?;
        // Implementation details
    }
}
```

#### 2. Payment-Handler Pallet
Manages micro-payments and real-time payouts to content creators based on viewer engagement.

#### 3. Stream-Registry Pallet
Maintains stream metadata, creator information, and stream categorization.

#### 4. Pricing-Engine Pallet
Controls dynamic pricing mechanisms and subscription tier management.

### Consensus Mechanism

The Vilokanam parachain uses a hybrid consensus approach:
- **Aura** for block production (deterministic, round-robin)
- **GRANDPA** for block finalization (probabilistic finality)

This combination provides both predictable block times and secure finality guarantees.

### Off-Chain Workers (OCW)

OCWs handle automated processes that shouldn't burden the blockchain:
- Real-time tick recording for active streams
- Payment calculation and distribution
- Stream metadata updates
- Analytics data aggregation

## Backend Services

### Node Implementation

The Substrate node includes:
- Custom chain specification for Vilokanam network
- RPC extensions for frontend integration
- Service configuration for validator and archive nodes
- CLI tools for node management

### API Layer

RESTful API endpoints provide data to frontend applications:
- Stream discovery and search
- Real-time engagement metrics
- Payment history and earnings data
- User profile and preference management

## Frontend Architecture

### Creator Dashboard

Built with Next.js 14 using the App Router pattern:
- Real-time camera integration with WebRTC
- OBS integration for professional streamers
- Analytics dashboard with engagement metrics
- Stream controls and moderation tools

### Viewer Interface

Also built with Next.js 14:
- Stream discovery with category browsing
- Real-time payment processing
- Interactive features (chat, reactions)
- Wallet integration for seamless payments

### Shared Components

Both applications utilize:
- UI component library (buttons, cards, forms)
- Blockchain SDK for Polkadot interactions
- State management with React Context and Redux Toolkit
- Authentication and wallet connectors

## Data Flow

### Viewer Engagement Cycle

1. **Stream Join**:
   - Viewer connects to stream through viewer interface
   - `join_stream` extrinsic submitted to blockchain
   - Viewer added to stream viewers list

2. **Tick Recording**:
   - OCW records ticks every second for active viewers
   - `record_tick` extrinsic submitted for each viewer
   - Tick count updated in blockchain storage

3. **Payment Processing**:
   - Payment-handler calculates charges based on ticks
   - Micro-payments transferred from viewer to creator
   - Transaction recorded on blockchain

4. **Earnings Distribution**:
   - Real-time updates to creator's earnings balance
   - Automatic withdrawal to creator's wallet based on thresholds
   - Transaction history maintained for tax purposes

### Creator Workflow

1. **Stream Setup**:
   - Creator configures stream through dashboard
   - Stream metadata registered on blockchain
   - Pricing and subscription tiers defined

2. **Live Streaming**:
   - Content delivered via WebRTC or OBS integration
   - Real-time analytics updated through OCW
   - Viewer interactions processed and displayed

3. **Earnings Management**:
   - Real-time earnings tracking
   - Withdrawal to wallet when thresholds met
   - Tax reporting and analytics available

## Security Architecture

### Authentication

- Wallet-based authentication using Polkadot.js Extension
- Secure session management with encrypted tokens
- Role-based access control for platform features

### Data Protection

- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Secure key management for blockchain transactions
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Network Security

- DDoS protection with Cloudflare
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure WebSocket connections for real-time data

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

- Kubernetes-based deployment for easy scaling
- Load balancing across multiple instances
- Database sharding for high-volume data

### Performance Optimization

- Caching with Redis for frequently accessed data
- Content delivery network (CDN) for media assets
- Database indexing for fast queries
- Efficient blockchain state management

### Resource Management

- Auto-scaling based on demand metrics
- Resource monitoring and alerting
- Cost optimization through efficient resource allocation
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Monitoring and Observability

### System Metrics

- Node health and performance monitoring
- Network latency and bandwidth utilization
- Storage capacity and utilization tracking
- CPU and memory usage across services

### Application Metrics

- Stream uptime and quality measurements
- Payment processing times and success rates
- User engagement and retention analytics
- Error rates and exception tracking

### Business Metrics

- Revenue and payout tracking
- User growth and acquisition metrics
- Content performance and popularity analysis
- Platform usage and engagement statistics
